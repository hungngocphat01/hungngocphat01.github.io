			<h3>1. Miyamizu Mitsuha - Your Name (13/01/2017 - 03/04/2017)</h3>
			<p>I "officially" became a weaboo on 01/01/2017, when my family has gone to Ho Chi Minh City to celebrate my cousin's wedding and of course also New Year Eve, leaving me alone at home. Having watched <em>5 cm/s</em> and <em>Himouto! Umaru-chan</em>, I became a weaboo. </br>
			Actually the first <b>real</b> anime that I had watched was Your Name in October 2016. But it was not until the beginning of January 2017 that I found it really interesting. The anime made me so crazy that I have watched it <b>13 times!</b></br>
			Beautiful as Mitsuha was, I fell in love with her at the, well, not really the first glance, because I first saw her months ago. But Mitsuha was my first waifu.</br>
			As a weaboo, I tried to watch as many anime as possible. I had a fear that I will fall in love with another girl and abandon Mitsuha at some time in the future. That fear was so big that I did even try to forget Mitsuha, starting a new weaboo life with another waifu. After considering among many candidates (Aqua [Konosuba], Kaori [Shigatsu], etc.), Tomori Nao was my final choice. Mitsuha would remain happily forever beside her loved one, Taki-kun.</br></p>

			<h3>2. Tomori Nao - Charlotte (03/04/2017 - 20/10/2017)</h3>
			<p>Well, Nao was the girl I selected for being my second waifu after Mitsuha. 1 month before I changed my waifu to Nao, in Vietnam there was a trend: spamming <em>"Nao iz da bezt" (literally "Nao is the best")</em> at everywhere that they could. Nao left no significant impression on me as Mitsuha was my best girl at that time. But later when I wanted to leave Mitsuha, Nao was my best candidate. Her charming point was her perfect blue eyes. I was so crazy about her blue eyes that my favourite girls later on mostly has blue eyes. One more good point of her was that she was very loyal. I won't spoil the reason here. Enjoy exploring it in the anime.</br>
			Well, that's enough.</p>
			<p>In this period, because I feared that I will fall in love with another girl and abandon Nao like what I did with Mitsuha, I "adopted" several other "minor" waifus.
			<ul>
				<li>May 2017: Tachibana Kanade (Angel Beats!)</li>
				<li>May 2017: Kuriyama Mirai (Kyoukai no Kanata)</li>
				<li>May 2017: Rem (Re: Zero)</li>
				<li>July 2017: Horikita Suzune (You-Zitsu)</li>
				<li>October 2017: Kousaka Honoka (Love Live!)</li>
			</ul>
			As they was only "minor" waifus, their "lifetime" was not so long. Kanade, Mirai and Rem was my waifu for only several weeks, while Suzune was longer, about 1 month. About Honoka, well... Let's talk about this special "minor" waifu later.</p>
			<p>I tried very hard to keep my love for Nao not being faded over the time. There were several times I thought Nao was very boring, and rather "old" because Charlotte was released 2 years before (2015). I searched for many different girls to replace Nao, and actually found one in July 2017. But she had not been my waifu until 20/10/2017...</p>

			<h3>3. Kousaka Honoka (20/10/2017 - ?)</h3>
			<p>Yes! I know! She was one of the "minor" waifus that I mentioned before!</p>
			<p>Actually, the way Honoka became my waifu is the same as the way I became a Love Liver.</p>
