## About this site
The content here acts as simple reminders for what I do periodically (re-install Arch Linux, etc.), or something that I have just figured out and need somewhere to note them down.

## About me
I am a Computer Science student at University of Science, Vietnam National University HCM. Currently pursuing the job of becoming a data scientist/data engineer in the next few years. My favourite nation, apart from mine, is Japan, so basically you can say I am a weeaboo `;)`. In fact, I have been learning Japanese since 2016 but still stucking at N4 (in 2021) because I don't really have time to learn it properly. But at least, I can translate and make subtitles for simple pop songs. I have been doing this since 2018 to improve both my Japanese and my Vietnamese literature skills. 

In my free time, I often play the guitar, browsing social networking sites and watch _Love Live!_ seiyuus doing their shits on YouTube. By the way, I am a big fan of the _Love Live!_ franchise since 2017, among which my favourite character is Kousaka Honoka (number one waifu), and Shibuya Kanon. I think I am in love (not _that_ kind of love) with Date Sayuri (voice of Shibuya Kanon) too! I have never seen such a fantastic _Love Live!_ seiyuu in a very long time, not to mention she's just around the same age as me.

Honestly, I still do not know what I want to become in the future. Back-end engineer? DevOps? AI Engineer? Data Scientist? Data Engineer? I have no idea. But my most significant strength at the moment (2022) is data science and machine learning.

I used to be extremely against Math in middle school (I thought $\sqrt{1}+\sqrt{2}=\sqrt{3}$), but now I have to study it in order to be a machine learning engineer. They're all just a ripped-off version of Stats/LinAlg/Calculus to some extent.

I have used all 3 main OSes including Windows (ME to 11), Linux (the distro is arch btw), and macOS (10.12 - 10.15), among which my most favourite one is OSX. It's like a fusion of both Windows, with its software abundance, and Linux, with its developer-friendly Unix environment, plus its blurry glassy fancy user interface.

A more technical-specific introduction with academic achievements can be seen on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/hungngocphat).

## About my alias
I'm Vietnamese, and my real name is in the subdomain of where I am hosting this blog ;)
Vietnam [used to use a Han-inspired writing system](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Vietnamese_characters) in almost 2000 years, so basically almost everything in modern Vietnamese can be rewritten in the old system. The language haven't change itself, only the script did. When written in the old system, my name is 雄鈺発. Since they are Han characters, they can also be pronounced in Japanese as well. 雄鈺発 can be read as `oh`, `takara` and `hiraki` respectively. Combining all of them and omitting the 'ra', we get Otaka Hiraki. But actually I prefer to be called Hiraki Hung with my surname being pronounced in Vietnamese.
