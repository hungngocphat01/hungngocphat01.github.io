## About this site
The content here acts as simple reminders for what I do periodically (re-install Arch Linux, etc.), or something that I have just figured out and need somewhere to note them down.

## About me
I am a computer science student, studying at University of Science, Vietnam National University of Ho Chi Minh. I am pursuing the job of becoming a data scientist/data engineer in the next few years. My favourite nation, apart from mine, is Japan, so basically you can say I am a weeaboo `;)`. In fact I have been learning Japanese since 2016 but still stucking at N4 (in 2021) because I don't really have time to learn it properly. But at least I can translate and make subtitles for simple pop songs. I have been doing this since 2018 to improve both my Japanese and my Vietnamese skill (though I'm Vietnamese :P). Speaking about the weeaboo stuffs, my beloved waifu is Kousaka Honoka (since 2017).

In my free time, I often play the piano (have just started in 2021), browsing the social networking sites and watch shitty stuffs on Youtube, etc. Sometimes I write small programs for fun.

As a programmer, I love doing everything: software engineer, machine learning engineer, data engineer, Assembly "software engineer", ..., but it's impossible to do them all at once right? I am aiming to become a data engineer anyway, so I often spend time for the rest in part of my leisure time. I am familiar with C++, Python, and a little Javascript and C#. 

I used to be extremely against Math in middle school (I thought $$\sqrt{1}+\sqrt{2}=\sqrt{3}$$), but now I have to study it in order to be a data engineer/machine learning engineer. They're all just automated Math to some extent.

My favourite operating system is macOS. I had used macOS Mojave and Catalina on my Hackintosh ThinkPad T430s for about a year. I was anti-Apple for years back then, but not anymore since I used macOS. My current laptop is ThinkPad T14 Gen 1 AMD. As an AMD laptop it is absolutely unable to run macOS, so I use Arch btw.

## About my alias
I am of Vietnamese nationality, a forgotten member of the East Asian culture sphere, and my real name is in the subdomain of where I am hosting this blog ;)
Vietnam [used to use the Chinese-like writing system](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Vietnamese_characters) in the feudal age, so basically almost everything in modern Vietnamese can be rewritten in the old system. My name is 雄鈺発 written in the Hán-Nôm system. Since they are Chinese characters, they can also be pronounced in Japanese as well. 雄鈺発 can be read as oh, takara and hiraki respectively. Combining all of them and simpliying the 'ra', we get Ohtaka Hiraki.
