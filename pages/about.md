I am a Computer Science student at University of Science, Vietnam National University HCM. Currently pursuing the job of becoming a data scientist/data engineer in the next few years. My favourite nation, apart from mine, is Japan, so basically you can say I am a weeaboo `;)`. In fact, I have been learning Japanese since 2016 but still stucking at N4 (in 2021) because I don't really have time to learn it properly. But at least, I can translate and make subtitles for simple pop songs. I have been doing this since 2018 to improve both my Japanese and my Vietnamese literature skills. 

In my free time, I often play the guitar, browsing social networking sites and watch _Love Live!_ seiyuus doing their shits on YouTube. By the way, I am a big fan of the _Love Live!_ franchise since 2017, among which my favourite character is Kousaka Honoka (number one waifu), and Shibuya Kanon. I think I am in love (not _that_ kind of love) with Date Sayuri too!

Honestly, I still do not know what do I want to become in the future. Back-end engineer? DevOps? AI Engineer? Data Scientist? Data Engineer? I have no idea. But my most significant strength at the moment (2022) is data science and machine learning.

I used to be extremely against Math in middle school (I thought $\sqrt{1}+\sqrt{2}=\sqrt{3}$), but now I have to study it in order to be a machine learning engineer. They're all just a ripped-off version of Stats/LinAlg/Calculus to some extent.

I have used all 3 main OSes including Windows (ME to 11), Linux (the distro is arch btw), and macOS (10.12 - 10.15), among which my most favourite one is OSX. It's like a fusion of both Windows, with its software abundance, and Linux, with its developer-friendly Unix environment, plus its blurry glassy fancy user interface.
