whoami: 
  - I am a senior CS student at <span class="b c-purple">University of Science, Vietnam National University HCM</span>,enthusiastically pursuing the career as an <span class="b c-orange">MLOps Engineer</span>
  - My main workstation is a ThinkPad T14 (Ryzen) running <span class="b c-orange">Fedora 37</span>. In the past i used arch btw, as suggested by my friend <a class="" href="http://ashpex.eu.org/">Ashpex</a>, who dragged me into this Linux lore.
  - Watching <span class="b c-orange">anime</span> and playing the guitar are what I often do when I'm not busy with tons of deadlines from my uni. I'm quite into 2.5D musical franchises, such as Love Live!, iDOLM@STER, BanG Dream!, etc. They are something very unique to the Japanese pop culture, in which my favourite character/seiyuu pair is Shibuya Kanon/Date Sayuri from <span class="b c-orange">Love Live!</span>.
