whoami:
  - Hey there. I'm a BSc grad from <span class="b c-purple">University of Science, Vietnam National University HCM</span>, currently diving into the world of <span class="b c-orange">Data/ML Engineer</span>.
  - My personal workstation is a <span class="b c-orange">MacBook Air M1</span>. In the past i used arch on my ThinkPad T14 btw, as suggested by my classmate <a class="" href="http://ashpex.eu.org/">Ashpex</a>, who dragged me into the Linux lore.
  - Watching <span class="b c-orange">anime</span> and playing the guitar are what I often do when I'm not busy with tons of deadlines from my uni or work. I'm quite into 2.5D musical franchises, such as Love Live!, iDOLM@STER, BanG Dream!, etc. Currently I'm simping Shibuya Kanon/Date Sayuri from <span class="b c-orange">Love Live!</span>.
