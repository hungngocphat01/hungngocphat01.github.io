It cannot be argued that Microsoft Windows is one of the most popular operating system running on electronic devices nowadays (the most being Android). It had undergone several ups and downs throughout its life to eventually achieve its number one position in the home computer market nowadays. Its history also partially reflects how technology had involved throughout the years.

# Why this post
I was born in 2001, so much of my knowledge about the old days of technology in general or the old versions of Windows in particular comes from the Internet. Although I am a Linux enthusiast at the moment, Windows is the operating system that grew up with me until I graduated high school (when I switched to macOS/Hackintosh and eventually Arch Linux) and I was very fancy about the old versions of Windows back when I was a high school student, so I decided to write something about it in order to spread the history of this popular operating system to more people who are as the same as my age or younger than me.

# Main families of Windows
Windows is not exactly an operating system. Is is a group of different operating systems that target to different platforms, with different groups of customers throughout its history. As far as I know, the only Windows family that is being actively developed at the moment is Windows NT (excluding Windows IoT). Its siblings, as follows are all dead: Windows 9x, Windows CE, Windows Mobile and Windows Phone.

# MS-DOS
Before getting into more details about Windows, let's start with MS-DOS first. MS-DOS is an ancronym for Microsoft Disk Operating System. It was first launched in 1981 by Microsoft as an operating system that mainly targeted to home computers with 16-bit CPUs. You had to type commands from the keyboard in order to use the computer. The mouse, which all of us just take for granted today, didn't really exist at that time.

The computer first starts into a command line interface with a blinking cursor, waiting for a command to be entered. There is no desktop, no wallpaper, just a black screen with full of texts like the techy hackers you see in American movies. 

To change between directories (folders) on your computers, you have to use the `cd` command. To list everything in the current directory, you have to type in `dir`. <br>To run a program (a game, etc.), you first have to move into its directory using a series of `cd` commands, then type the name of the executable of the program. There is no fancy file explorer or the so-called "My Computer" for you to navigate thoughout the file systems. "How tf could you play games on this thing?". Yes, it could.

You could create and edit documents on it:

And the thing that most Vietnamese students are terrify of: writing programs with Turbo Pascal.

Things had not yet ended with just typing commands in order to use the computer. Microsoft moved on to develop a new operating system that we all know today: Microsoft Windows.

# The early days of Windows
In this section, I will cover Windows 1.x, 2.x and 3.x.

Back in the 80s, the most popular operating system that feature a graphical user interface is an operating system simply called "System" that runs on Macintosh machines. It was the early version of what we call macOS today. 

Back to Windows. The first version of Windows is Windows 1.0, which was released in 1983. It is not really an operating system, but only acts as a graphical front-end for MS-DOS.

It is packed with a few simple yet interesting graphical programs such as a riversi game, a lively analog clock which sits in the corner of your screen, a simple word processing program called Write and the thing we all know and love: Microsoft Paint, and many more.

Unfortunately, Windows 1.0 was considered as a flop and didn't have a very welcome reception due to its poor performance, doubtful support for MS-DOS applications and introducing the usage of the "mouse", which was a relatively new concept at that time. Microsoft released several small updates for Windows 1.0 several years after that and eventually came up with a new version of Windows: Windows 2.0
