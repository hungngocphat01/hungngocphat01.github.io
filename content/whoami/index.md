## A Wanderer

{{< figure src="elaina.jpg" caption="Elaina - The Wandering Witch" >}}

While "researcher" might be the conventional label for my professional work, I've always seen myself more as a _wanderer_. 

From tinkering with old computers, bricking and reviving Android devices during secondary school years, and [running unlikely operating systems on unsupported hardware](https://github.com/hungngocphat01/OpenCore-Thinkpad-T430s), I've carried a habit of exploring technology in slightly unconventional ways. None of my phone ran the original OS they originally came with (Apple devices are exceptions). That spirit of exploration continues to guide me, whether in research, hacking around with systems, or simply following curiosity wherever it leads.

I started out on Windows like most kids of the early Gen Z. But in late primary school, my curiosity got me installing Ubuntu in a virtual machine on a painfully slow Pentium 4 running XP, which was my home computer. It barely worked, but it was enough. 

{{< style "text-align: center;" >}}
That first step into the unknown quietly decided the rest.
{{< /style >}}

From there, it became a trait, a habit: rooting phones, flashing ROMs; breaking things, fixing them again. All of my phones, ranging from Symbian S40 to Android, did not run the original OS that it originally came with. Running Android on PC? Sounds boring. I got Windows 95 running on my Android tablet (of course in an emulator) to write Pascal code on the way when I was in the competitive coding team of my secondary school (2014).

I bricked my first Android device - an Asus Fonepad so many times that the local Asus service center must have thought I was a warranty scammer. By high school, I was writing small tools in Access to help out with the family business, and before I knew it, I was a CS student.

I've always enjoyed taking things apart, especially when I wasn't supposed to. Later, I met [ashpex](https://ashpex.net) during my college years, who nudged me toward Arch Linux, and I never really looked back to Windows. Apple's locked-down ecosystem annoyed me, until I discovered Hackintosh and got macOS running on my ThinkPad T430s. That changed my mind. Over the years I cycled through machines and systems, until I eventually it became the end of the journey: I bought my MacBook Air M1. Then it came the iPhone 13, iPad Pro M1, and the most recently an iPhone 16 Pro. I was locked in the walled apple garden (apple in lowercase).

<!-- Despite the nature, I never saw myself as someone who could become a researcher. The word felt tied to theory-heavy work and scary math equations. But it happened anyways. I published my first paper during my undergraduate years, spent two years in industry, and then fate took another turn: I came to Japan for graduate study. -->

<!-- I don't know when the next turn will come, or where it'll lead. But for now, I'm just a [未熟DREAMER](https://love-live.fandom.com/wiki/Mijuku_DREAMER#Kanji). -->

## What's 'hiraki'?

It's the _kunyomi_ reading of my name 發 in kanji. A linguistically correct Japanese alias.

# Recommended content

I don't read books because I'm lazy. Recently I have picked up the habit of reading light novels for the sake of learning Japanese (going through the _Shinkanzen Master N2 Dokkai_ is boring).

## YouTube Channels

I cannot stand having dinner without these. Also, shoutout to these channels that helped me score a 9.0 in the IELTS listening test (2023).

📺 **Retrotech**: [This Does Not Compute](https://www.youtube.com/@ThisDoesNotCompute), [LGR](https://www.youtube.com/@LGR), [Action Retro](https://www.youtube.com/@ActionRetro), [MichaelMJD](https://www.youtube.com/@MichaelMJD)


📚 **Knowledge**: [Asianometry](https://www.youtube.com/@Asianometry), [ColdFusion](https://www.youtube.com/coldfusion), [Johnny Harris](https://www.youtube.com/@johnnyharris) (only for old videos)

## Japanese learning materials

I don't really follow any Japanese learning YouTube channels except [Kaname Naito](https://www.youtube.com/@kanamenaito). I've always believed in learning the "right" way, by working through all the boring textbook stuff first. Once you're solid enough to score around 150/180 on the JLPT N3 mock tests, that's when real context-based learning starts to pay off. 

For the beginner levels, just follow _Minna no Nihongo_. For N3, just follow the _Mimikara Oboeru_ for vocabulary and _Shinkanzen Master_ for everything else.

That said, it doesn't mean you should avoid native content altogether. I was lucky. During high school, I was completely obsessed with **Love Live!**. Its lyrics are surprisingly beginner-friendly (for the N5-N4 level) compared to most mainstream content made for native speakers. The lore behind it was that: the lyrics were supposed to be written by the characters, who were high school students, so they tended to be much simpler, definitely more approachable than something like YOASOBI. By the time I finished N4, I had already picked up a decent chunk of vocabulary that never showed up in textbooks like _Minna no Nihongo_.

The approach is simple: just listen to the songs while reading the lyrics. Over time, you'll start to notice recurring vocabulary and grammar patterns. Just focus on picking those up.
  
Besides anime and light novels, I recommend checking out [MariMariMari](https://www.youtube.com/@marymarymary80s). It's a channel made for native speakers (so the pace is very fast for a N3 holder), but it's a great way to absorb natural language.

Log unfamiliar words into Anki. In addition to textbook-based decks, I keep a separate one just for this purpose: _Vocab in the wild_. But don' overdo it. If you're too aggressive, you'll end up buried under a huge backlog of vocab in no time.

I think I will write a dedicated post on this topic later.
